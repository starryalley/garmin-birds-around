# Birds Around Me

This is a [Garmin Connect IQ](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/) watch widget which uses [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) data to list possible bird species around your current location.

You can see the list of bird species from observations within 30 days and within 50km radius (configurable) of your location. The bird's scentific name, observed date and location are also shown in detail page.


## Reason and Possible use case

For me I've been using [GoBird](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thenerdbirder.GoBird&hl=en_US) and [eBird app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.birds.ebird&hl=en_US) in the field with great success. However it makes sense to just have a text list of possible bird species around me on my watch where I can glance over during an activity (for example, kayaking, cycling etc) when I encounter a bird which I can't recognize at first place. 

This app is created in the hope that I can be aware of any new possible bird species observed recently around me, be it during my usual commuting route or during my kayaking session.

### eBird API

I'm using the excellent free [eBird API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59?version=latest) for all the data shown in this app.
